# Enron-corop-Fraud-Detection-
Fraud Detection from Enron Email Corpus
This project tries to Identify people who may be involved in Enron Fraud.
Here we are using machine learning techniques to predict if a person is involved in the fraud.
We have extraxted the financial (salary,bonus etc) and email features (like mails sent to people who were charged with fraud)
of the people and then trained the classifier on this data set.
